# change tracker notes

- I realise this has probably been made, but another interesting project could be to make a program designed to alert me based on some kind of input value that changes over a certain interval

- I'd try using it for maybe a fun way to see stock swings and dips

- I could track prices via some kind of price history feed? ... seems interesting
